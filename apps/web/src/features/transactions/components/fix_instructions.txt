To fix the NewTransactionForm.tsx file:

1. Open the file in your code editor
2. Go to the very end of the file
3. Delete all content from line 1343 to the end
4. Add the following single line at line 1343:
}

5. Make sure there's exactly one newline character after the closing brace
6. Save the file

This will remove the invalid characters and properly close the function with a clean ending.
